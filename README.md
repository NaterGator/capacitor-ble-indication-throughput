This is the companion project for https://github.com/NaterGator/zephyr-ble-notif-throughput.

This Vue 3 Capacitor app will allow your phone to scan for the peripheral from the Zephyr project and start/stop data flow between the devices. This is a toy application designed to evaluate the raw performance of the BLE notification data path through the https://github.com/capacitor-community/bluetooth-le plugin.
